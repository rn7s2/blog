# Async Rust: A Naive Work Queue using Channel

When doing I/O intensive work such as web crawling, we might want an async
work queue to maximize the performance of our crawlers.

This post demonstrates how to implement a simple (and naive) async work queue
in `Rust` using `Futures` and how to use `Channel` to perform `ITC`
(Inter-Thread Communication).

## Before you read, you should know...
- basic concepts of `Channel` or `CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes)`
- basic ideas of asynchronous programming
- basic knowledge of `Rust`
- basic knowledge of `cargo` to manage dependencies and the build process \
  (this post won't demo how to build and run the program)

## TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)
### Dependencies
```toml
[dependencies]
futures = "^0.3.0"
tokio = { version = "^1.24.2", features = ["full"] }
```

### Source Code
```rust,editable
use std::sync::Arc;

use futures::future::join_all;
use tokio::sync::{mpsc::channel, Mutex};

const WORKERS: usize = 3;

// parameterss needed by a task
#[derive(Debug)]
struct JobParam {
    val: usize,
}

// do workers' jobs
async fn process(id: usize, v: JobParam) {
    println!("worker {}, processing {:?}", id, v);
    tokio::time::sleep(tokio::time::Duration::from_secs(id as u64 + 1)).await;
    println!("worker {}, finished processing {:?}", id, v);
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let mut tasks = Vec::new();

    let (tx, rx) = channel(WORKERS);
    let amrx = Arc::new(Mutex::new(rx));

    for i in 0..WORKERS {
        let mrx = amrx.clone();
        tasks.push(tokio::spawn(async move {
            loop {
                let mut guard = mrx.lock().await;
                if let Some(v) = guard.recv().await {
                    // drop the mutex lock
                    drop(guard);
                    process(i, v).await;
                } else {
                    // no more values to receive
                    break;
                }
            }
        }));
    }

    // dispatch jobs to workers
    for i in 0..20 {
        tx.send(JobParam { val: i })
            .await
            .expect("send params to workers failed.");
    }
    drop(tx);

    // wait all tasks to finish
    join_all(tasks).await;
}
```

### Output
```
worker 0, processing JobParam { val: 0 }
worker 1, processing JobParam { val: 1 }
worker 2, processing JobParam { val: 2 }
worker 0, finished processing JobParam { val: 0 }
worker 0, processing JobParam { val: 3 }
worker 1, finished processing JobParam { val: 1 }
worker 1, processing JobParam { val: 4 }
worker 0, finished processing JobParam { val: 3 }
worker 0, processing JobParam { val: 5 }
worker 2, finished processing JobParam { val: 2 }
worker 2, processing JobParam { val: 6 }
worker 0, finished processing JobParam { val: 5 }
worker 0, processing JobParam { val: 7 }
worker 1, finished processing JobParam { val: 4 }
worker 1, processing JobParam { val: 8 }
worker 0, finished processing JobParam { val: 7 }
worker 0, processing JobParam { val: 9 }
worker 0, finished processing JobParam { val: 9 }
worker 0, processing JobParam { val: 10 }
worker 2, finished processing JobParam { val: 6 }
worker 2, processing JobParam { val: 11 }
worker 1, finished processing JobParam { val: 8 }
worker 1, processing JobParam { val: 12 }
worker 0, finished processing JobParam { val: 10 }
worker 0, processing JobParam { val: 13 }
worker 0, finished processing JobParam { val: 13 }
worker 0, processing JobParam { val: 14 }
worker 1, finished processing JobParam { val: 12 }
worker 1, processing JobParam { val: 15 }
worker 0, finished processing JobParam { val: 14 }
worker 0, processing JobParam { val: 16 }
worker 2, finished processing JobParam { val: 11 }
worker 2, processing JobParam { val: 17 }
worker 0, finished processing JobParam { val: 16 }
worker 0, processing JobParam { val: 18 }
worker 1, finished processing JobParam { val: 15 }
worker 1, processing JobParam { val: 19 }
worker 0, finished processing JobParam { val: 18 }
worker 2, finished processing JobParam { val: 17 }
worker 1, finished processing JobParam { val: 19 }
```

## Spawn some workers and store them into a `Vec`
```rust
const WORKERS: usize = 3;

let mut tasks = Vec::new();

for i in 0..WORKERS {
    tasks.push(tokio::spawn(async move {
        loop {
            todo!("receive JobParam and do the actual work");
        }
    }));
}
```

## Create a fixed-size `Channel`
```rust
let (tx, rx) = channel(WORKERS);
let amrx = Arc::new(Mutex::new(rx));
```
A channel is a pair of `Sender` and `Receiver`.
The channel can contains up to `WORKERS` elements, then it will block the sender's thread
until there's free room in the channel.

To share `rx` (the `Receiver`) across workers, an `Arc<Mutex<>>` is needed to hold the
ownership of the `rx` and only allows one thread to acquire the lock.

## Receive `JobParam` in workers and do the actual job
```rust
// parameters needed by a task
#[derive(Debug)]
struct JobParam {
    val: usize,
}

// do workers' jobs
async fn process(id: usize, v: JobParam) {
    println!("worker {}, processing {:?}", id, v);
    tokio::time::sleep(tokio::time::Duration::from_secs(id as u64 + 1)).await;
    println!("worker {}, finished processing {:?}", id, v);
}
```
`JobParam` is all information needed by a worker to do its job.

Then, we fill the `todo!` earlier with fllowing code:
```rust
for i in 0..WORKERS {
    let mrx = amrx.clone();
    tasks.push(tokio::spawn(async move {
        loop {
            let mut guard = mrx.lock().await;
            if let Some(v) = guard.recv().await {
                // drop the mutex lock
                drop(guard);
                process(i, v).await;
            } else {
                // no more values to receive
                break;
            }
        }
    }));
}
```
Because of the Rust ownership model, we need to clone the `Arc` so that
we can move the reference into the async block. Then we can use it as a
regular smart pointer.

First, acquire the `Mutex` lock, and receive params from the channel.

If there's no more values, we should terminate this worker.
Otherwise, we return the lock by dropping the `MutexGuard`, and awaits
the actual process to finish.

## Dispatch `JobParams` to workers
```rust
// dispatch jobs to workers
for i in 0..20 {
    tx.send(JobParam { val: i })
        .await
        .expect("send params to workers failed.");
}
drop(tx);
```

## Wait until all workers to finish
```rust
// wait all tasks to finish
join_all(tasks).await;
```
